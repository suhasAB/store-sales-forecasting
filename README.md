## 1.Abstract:

The ability to predict the sales of a variety of stores is highly sought out in supply chain logistics, as it finds applications in increasing customer satisfaction and reducing food waste. <br>
We are proposing use of multiple **Supervised Learning methods** to predict the sales of stores based on time series dataset of Corporaci√≥n Favorita,an Ecuador based grocery retailer. Ecuador is a country whose economy is strongly dependant on the oil and fluctuates with the price of oil. <br>
The dataset includes multiple csv sheets of time series data. We will try to evaluate the different aspects that might impact the sales in a store like Holiday seasons,Oil prices and historical sales data from a variety of stores. <br> 
We plan on using different Supervised Learning models to predict the prices and then evaluate which of those models give out the best results. Few of the option we can considor are <br>
- Linear Regression
- Gradient Boost(XGBoost)
- Random Forest
- SVM etc.
